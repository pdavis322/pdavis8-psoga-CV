## Part A: Test Dataset
For our testing dataset, we augmented the original videos we used to train the model with four additional videos taken at different angles. We used around 60 images per video taken throughout the duration of each video for a total of roughly 240 new images. 
As an example of the differences between our testing set and our training set, this first image is taken from our training set:
