# Part 1 Deliverable
## Part A: Database
Our database will initially consist of twenty videos of chess games being played from start to finish, downloaded from YouTube. Links to these videos are provided in `videos_list.txt`. If more training data is needed, we will use similar videos from YouTube. Additionally, we have downloaded a set of images of chess positions ([roboflow](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/chess-full), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tannergi/chess-piece-detection)) which we will use for classifying chess pieces if neccessary.
